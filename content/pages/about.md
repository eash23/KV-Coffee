Kilovolt Coffee opened in April 2014 on Mandela Pkwy. At the time, there were no other coffee shops in the neighborhood. A lot has changed and we have lost the lease on 1829 Mandela. We are opening a coffee and espresso food truck and reopening our cafe at [1746 13th Street](https://www.google.com/search?q=1746+13th+street+oakland&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS992US992&oq=1746+13t&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggBECMYJzIGCAAQRRg5MgYIARAjGCcyBwgCEAAYgAQyCAgDEAAYFhgeMggIBBAAGBYYHjINCAUQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAYQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAcQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAgQABiGAxiABBiKBTIKCAkQABiABBiiBNIBCDQwNjVqMWo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
