Summary: Short version for index and feeds

Kilovolt Coffee opened in April 2014 on Mandela Pkwy. At the time, there were no other coffee shops in the neighborhood. A lot has changed and we have lost the lease on 1829 Mandela. We are opening a coffee and espresso food truck and reopening our cafe at [1746 13th Street](https://www.google.com/search?q=1746+13th+street+oakland&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS992US992&oq=1746+13t&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggBECMYJzIGCAAQRRg5MgYIARAjGCcyBwgCEAAYgAQyCAgDEAAYFhgeMggIBBAAGBYYHjINCAUQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAYQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAcQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAgQABiGAxiABBiKBTIKCAkQABiABBiiBNIBCDQwNjVqMWo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)


KV was founded on the principles of creativity and DIY. We encourage everyone to take the wheel in life and create the experiences they want to have.

_It is the satisfaction of doing it for yourself and motivating others to work with you in bringing it about. It is about the fun, innovation, creativity with the rewards being far greater than purely financial.
