This week the van was inspected by the California Department of Housing and Community Development.
I wasn't completely done but they came and saw and agreed I was on the right track. I thought they were gonna give me a list of things to do and send pictures, and then approve my truck. To my surprise they approved it right then and there. I got my insignia, I'm one step closer to opening up.
